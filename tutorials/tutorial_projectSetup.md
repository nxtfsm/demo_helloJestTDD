# [Project Setup](#tutorial_projectSetup)
## [Goal:](#tutorial_projectSetup_goal)<br>
Our new eLearning platform features a dropdown menu that lets users change the background location displayed in their browser app. Right now, it renders in a way that would make users of our App feel frustrated. :cursing_face:. In this project, you'll make the overall experience feel friendlier (:nerd_face:) by updating our dropdown menu feature.<br>

The width of the dropdown menu gets determined by the length of the place name for whichever location is currently selected. This means that all the other labels will show up just fine if 'Kiribati' is currently selected, but at the other end of the scale, when a user chooses 'Yap', the dropdown will cut off characters in every other label.<br>
