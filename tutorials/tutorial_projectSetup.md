# [Project Setup](#tutorial_projectSetup)
## [Goal:](#tutorial_projectSetup_goal)<br>
Our new eLearning platform features a dropdown menu that lets users change the background location displayed in their browser app. Right now, it renders in a way that would be frustrating for users of our App. In this project, we'll make the overall experience feel friendlier by updating this dropdown menu feature.<br>

The width of this dropdown menu gets determined by the length of the place name for whichever location is currently selected. This means that all the other labels will show up if 'Kiribati' is currently selected, but at the other end of the scale, when a user chooses 'Yap', the dropdown will cut off characters in every other label.<br>
